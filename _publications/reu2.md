The paper I wrote for the University of Chicago 2023 REU. I introduced some concepts of geometric measure theory, including rectifiable sets, varifolds, general and integral currents, then proved the deformation theorem, rectifiability theorem for normal currents, and a version of Plateau's problem phrased in the language of currents.
