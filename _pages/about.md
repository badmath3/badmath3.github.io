I am Raman Aliakseyeu, an incoming Ph.D student in Mathematics at Georgia Tech. Currently I am finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago.  


I am currently interested broadly in geometry and topology. I will probably settle on some area in differential geometry or low-dimensional topology.
